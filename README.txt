Khola's Fashion Hub - README
----------------------------

What's included:
- index.html (Home)
- about.html (About - left blank for you to edit)
- products.html (Products & Gallery with your images)
- contact.html (Contact form ready to connect to Formspree)
- style.css (Purple & Silver theme)
- /images/ (your uploaded photos)

Contact form setup (Formspree):
1) Go to https://formspree.io and sign up for a free account.
2) Create a new form and follow their instructions to obtain your Formspree endpoint URL (it looks like https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx).
3) Open contact.html and replace the form's action value (https://formspree.io/f/yourFormID) with your endpoint URL.
4) Save and upload the site to your hosting. When users submit the form, Formspree will forward messages to your email address (kholaadnan2@gmail.com).

Notes:
- Social icons are present in the footer as visual icons only (no links) per your request.
- The About page is intentionally left blank for you to add your brand story.
- To host the site: upload the whole folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your web host).

If you want, I can also:
- Add meta tags for social sharing
- Replace emojis in footer with SVG icons
- Connect the form and test it for you (you'll need to provide the Formspree endpoint)
